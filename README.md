"You can't get your hand around it. No one's going to buy that." - 2010

The iPad's 10-inch screen was "the minimum size required to create great tablet apps." He said even making images appear sharper on the screen wouldn't help smaller tablets become usable "unless your tablet also includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size. There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them" - 2010

"It’s like we said on the iPad, if you see a stylus, they blew it," -2010

"I think there's going to be two kinds of devices in the music space. One is going to be just the pure evolved music device. People want it for music, maybe music videos, maybe occasional movie, but they really want it for music," - Steve Jobs, The Wall Street Journal 2008

"We don't know how to make a $500 computer that's not a piece of junk." - October 2008, the iPad (1st generation) base-model was $499

"The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. They can make a call, they can send an email, they can look up a location on Google Maps. And guess what? There’s no SDK that you need! You’ve got everything you need if you know how to write apps using the most modern web standards to write amazing apps for the iPhone today. So developers, we think we’ve got a very sweet story for you. You can begin building your iPhone apps today." - Steve Jobs 2007

"Who wants a stylus?" Jobs said while introducing the iPhone. "You have to get 'em, put 'em away, you lose 'em. Yuch! Nobody wants a stylus. So let's not use a stylus." -2007

"There are no plans to make a tablet. It turns out people want keyboards... We look at the tablet, and we think it is going to fail." - 2003

"I'm not convinced people want to watch movies on a tiny little screen. To paraphrase Bill Clinton, 'It's the music, stupid, it's the music!' Music's been around for a long time, will continue to be, it's huge." - 2003

"We told them the music subscription services they were pushing were going to fail. MusicNet was gonna fail. Pressplay was gonna fail. Here’s why: People don’t want to buy their music as a subscription. They bought 45s, then they bought LPs, they bought cassettes, they bought 8-tracks, then they bought CDs. They’re going to want to buy downloads." -Rolling Stone, 2003

"Is the web going to be a life-changing event for millions of people? No. I mean, maybe. But it's not an assured yes at this point. And it'll probably creep up on people." - Steve Jobs, Wired 1996

"You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new. It took us three years to build the NeXT computer. If we'd given customers what they said they wanted, we'd have built a computer they'd have been happy with a year after we spoke to them—not something they'd want now." - Steve Jobs, Inc. Magazine, 1989

"Most of the new, innovative companies are focusing on the software. I think there will be lots of innovation in the areas of software but not in hardware." - Steve Jobs, Playboy 1983

"Some people say give the customers what they want, but that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, 'If I'd ask customers what they wanted, they would've told me a faster horse.' People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page."
